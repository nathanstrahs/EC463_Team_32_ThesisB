Our team's project involves taking an scanning electron microscope (SEM) scanning and detector voltage waveforms and feeding them to a FPGA-based SoC hardware platform, 
which converts those signals into a digital format to be sent via USB over to a host PC. We will then take those electrical signals and vector embed them to create a machine-readable format, then passing them to a State Space Model, allowing us to generate a condensed version of these signals.
We then take those learned signals, and pass them as annotations to the medical imaging Vision Language Model. We then combine these signals with the image generated by the SEM, and then are able to ask it questions about each specific scan from the SEM with domain generalization.
Finally, we use OTFS modulation in MIMO systems combined with C&F lattice coding strategies to enable reliable communication in high-mobility and high-Doppler environments.
