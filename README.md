Our team's project is scanning voltage waveforms and feeding them to an FPGA-based SoC hardware platform, which we vector embed to create a machine-readable format, passing them to a State-Space-Model, then generating a condensed version of these signals. We then pass them as annotations to the medical imaging Vision-Language-Model, then combine those generated by the SEM, and are able to ask it questions about each specific scan from the SEM, with domain generalization. Then we broadcast using MIMO.
