Our project explores signal-to-model pipelines by scanning voltage waveforms, embedding them for FPGA-based SoC processing, and condensing them with a State-Space Model. These outputs are linked to medical imaging Vision-Language Models, enabling annotation and query over specific scans with improved domain generalization. The final signals are integrated and broadcast using MIMO.
